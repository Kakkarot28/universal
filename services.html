            The financial services sector provides financial services to people and corporations. This segment of the economy is made up of a variety of financial firms including banks, investment houses, lenders, finance companies, real estate brokers, and insurance companies. As noted above, the financial services industry is probably the most important sector of the economy, leading the world in terms of earnings and equity market capitalization. Large conglomerates dominate this sector, but it also includes a diverse range of smaller companies.

            Companies in the financial services industry manage money. For instance, a financial advisor manages assets and offers advice on behalf of a client. The advisor does not directly provide investments or any other product, rather, they facilitate the movement of funds between savers and the issuers of securities and other instruments. This service is a temporary task rather than a tangible asset.

The project company is incorporated by the sponsor as per the requirement of the Government authority or taken over from such Authority by purchase of shares. If there is a mezzanine funding component in the project financing, the Intercreditor Agreement sets out terms of subordination and other principles to apply between the senior debt providers and the mezzanine debt providers.

      "The Asset Purchase Agreement is an agreement between the seller and the purchaser of assets. In an Asset Purchase Agreement, the individual value of assets is assigned and the seller transfers the assets to the purchaser. The assets transferred in an asset purchase agreement include: Plant and machinery. Goodwill.",
    subtext:
      "Provisions of an APA may include payment of purchase price, monthly installments, liens and encumbrances on the assets, condition precedent for the closing, etc. An APA differs from a stock purchase agreement (SPA) where company shares, title to assets, and title to liabilities are also sold.The buyer must represent its authority to purchase the asset. The seller must represent its authority to sell the asset. Additionally, the seller represents that the purchase price of the asset is equal to its value, and that the seller is not in financial or legal trouble.In the context of a merger or acquisition transaction, asset purchase agreements have a distinct set of advantages and disadvantages compared to using an equity (or stock) purchase agreement or a merger agreement. In an equity or merger acquisition, the purchaser is guaranteed to receive all of the target's assets without exception, but also automatically assumes all of the target's liabilities. An asset purchase agreement, alternatively, allows not only for a transaction where only some of the assets are transferred (which is sometimes desired) but also allows the parties to negotiate which liabilities of the target are expressly assumed by the purchaser, and allows the purchaser to leave behind those liabilities it does not wish to accept (or does not know about). A disadvantage of an asset purchase agreement is that it can often result in a greater number of change of control issues. For example, contracts held by a target, and acquired by a purchaser, will often require the consent of the counterparty in the context of an asset deal, whereas it is less common that such consent will be needed in connection with an equity sale or merger agreement."
